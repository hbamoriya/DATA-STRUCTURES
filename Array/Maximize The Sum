. Your task is to maximize the sum of chosen numbers. 

You are given

test cases.

Input format

    The first line contains a single integer 

denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
and
denoting the length of the array and the maximum number of distinct integers you can choose.
The second line of each test case contains
space-separated integers denoting the integer array

    .

Output format

For each test case(in a separate line), print the maximum sum you can obtain by choosing some elements such that the number of distinct integers chosen is at most
. If you cannot choose any element, output

.

Explanation

In the first test case, we have
, . Since we can choose atmost 1 distinct integer, we choose . The sum is also

 and we output it.

In the second test case, we have
, . We need to choose atmost 2 distinct integers, we choose . Note that the condition is choosing atmost distinct integers. So we can choose repeated number as many times as we want. The sum is and we output it.
